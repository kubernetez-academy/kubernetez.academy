overview: |
  This training focuses on a dev/devops perspective. You start from
  packaging your application (with whatever language you use) then run your
  complete stack (with db, proxy, loadbalancer) all in containers, to reach
  dev-prod parity.

learningOutcomes:
  - Understand containerization concepts and Docker architecture
  - Build efficient Docker images using best practices
  - Manage containers, networks, and volumes effectively
  - Create multi-container applications with Docker Compose
  - Deploy containerized applications to dev/test/production
  - Design container-native application architectures
