overview: Dagger revolutionizes CI/CD by providing a programmable CI/CD engine that runs pipelines as code. In this comprehensive training, you'll learn to build, test, and deploy applications using Dagger's powerful, multi-language SDK, creating pipelines that are portable, fast, and maintainable.

learningOutcomes:
  - Build production-ready CI/CD pipelines using Dagger
  - Create portable pipelines that run consistently across environments
  - Integrate Dagger with popular CI platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
  - Design reusable pipeline modules and share them across teams
  - Implement security best practices in CI/CD workflows
